=head1 NAME

Dir::Which - Search for directory entries in a list of directories.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dir::Which qw/ which /;

  @entries = which(
               -entry => "myprog.conf", 
               -env => "myprog_path", 
               -defaultpath => ".:".$FindBin::Bin.":/etc:/usr/local/etc") ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module searches directory entries (files, dirs, links, named pipes...) in a list of directories specified as a path-like string.

The path string can be specified in an environment variable or as an argument.

=head1 FUNCTION

=head2 which

This fonction takes named arguments :

=over 8

=item -entry (mandatory) 

The name of the searched entry. 

=item -env (optional) 

The name of a environment variable supposed to be a path-like string, and which be used to search the specified entry.
If one or more entries are found in this path, the search ends and returns these values.

=item -defaultpath (optional) 

The path used to search the specified entry, if C<-env> argument is missing, 
or if this environment variable doesn't exist, or if no entry have been found in it. 

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUE

In scalar context, the first match is returned according to the order of the directories
listed in the path string, or undef if no match can be found.

In list context, all matches are returned in the order corresponding to the directories
listed in the path string (and so an empty list if no match is found).

=head1 EXAMPLES

  $file = which(
               -entry => "myprog.conf", 
               -defaultpath => ".:".$FindBin::Bin.":/etc:/usr/local/etc"
          ) ;

Searches the absolute name of C<myprog.conf> successivement in the current directory, the directory which contains the program binary,
C</etc> and C</usr/local/etc>. Returns the first entry found.

  @entries = which(
               -entry => "myprog.d", 
               -defaultpath => ".:".$FindBin::Bin.":/etc:/usr/local/etc"
             ) ;

Returns the absolute names of C<myprog.d> searched in the current directory, the directory which contains the program binary,
C</etc> and C</usr/local/etc>. 

  $file = which(
               -entry => "myprog.conf", 
               -env => "myprog_path"
          ) ;

Searches the absolute name of C<myprog.conf> in the path stored in the environment variable C<myprog_path>.
Returns the name of the first file found, or C<undef> if no entry found.

  $file = which(
               -entry => "myprog.conf", 
               -env => "myprog_path", 
               -defaultpath => ".:".$FindBin::Bin.":/etc:/usr/local/etc"
          ) ;

Searches the absolute name of C<myprog.conf> in the path stored in the environment variable C<myprog_path>. 
If no file has been found, searches successivement in the current directory, the directory which contains the program binary,
C</etc> and C</usr/local/etc>. Returns the name of the first entry found, or C<undef> if no entry found.

=head1 NOTES

If C<Env::Path> module is installed it will be used. This allows for
more portability than simply assuming colon-separated paths.
